# Neurospatio: the library for non-linear spatial 2D interpolation

### Description
Developed as Kriging method alternative in non-linear cases, *Neurospatio* provides such features as:
- Radial or directed properties proliferation,
- The consistency of prediction between set of dependent spatial properties (i.e. humidity & temperature),
- The flexible settings that allow make predictions with high-degree of precision,
- The library based on Tensorflow and Keras and, therefore, you may use your own customizations exploiting well-known tools.
 
### How to Install
Type in your terminal 
`python setup.py install`

### How to Use In Your Project
The **tests** folder contains most typical cases of using *Neurospatio* library.
